# Iittle_Bag_OOP
An object-oriented C++ console application to automate sales management for a bag store. Supports two user roles: Manager and Cashier. Cashiers can view, add, and search bag details by category (e.g., totes, backpacks). Managers can also create new cashier accounts. All data is stored and retrieved using file handling.
